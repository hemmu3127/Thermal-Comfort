Developed a predictive model for thermal comfort based on building types and environmental features. The project involved comprehensive data preprocessing, including feature engineering, handling missing values, and categorical encoding using LabelEncoder. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive insights and prepare the dataset. Leveraged multiple deep learning architectures, including MLP, CNN, DNN, LSTM, and RNN, and implemented a stacking ensemble model using three MLPs with Logistic Regression as the meta-model.

Key methodologies included using TensorFlow Keras and PyTorch for model building, applying advanced techniques like early stopping, dropout, L2 regularization, and hyperparameter tuning via Hyperband. Employed k-fold cross-validation, experimented with varying batch sizes, epochs, and activation functions (ReLU, LeakyReLU, Softmax), ensuring robust model performance and generalization.
